Hello visitor! Welcome to my site. I have here all kinds of sorts of types of groups of
classes of stuff related to my professional life but also not.

I am a Computer and Systems Engineer from [UNAL][nacho] (Colombia). I hold a MEng. in
the same subject from the same university.

The things I like to do include: coding and fiction writing. The things I tend to enjoy
the most are often absurd, niche and obscure, _i.e.,_ most things creative.

## Selected Projects ##

The following is a list of the projects in which I have been the main contributor, sorted
from more recent to oldest:

- [Doryta](https://github.com/helq/doryta):
    Spiking neuron model simulator written as a PDES model (Parallel Discrete Event
    Simulation). Current PhD work.
- [Safety Envelopes](https://github.com/helq/safety-envelopes-sentinels):
    Agda code implementing the concept of "safety envelopes" applied to the classical
    aerospacial problem of stall detection.
- [Pytropos](https://github.com/helq/pytropos):
    My Master's research final project. A Python abstract interpreter to check for the
    shape of tensors without 'running' the code (a linter).
- [tensorflow-haskell-deptyped](https://github.com/helq/tensorflow-haskell-deptyped):
    An experiment using Dependent Types in Haskell to check the shapes of Tensorflow
    tensors at compilation time.
- [ChemKinLator](https://gitlab.com/homochirality/chemkinlator):
    Simulator of chemical networks written in C++ and Fortran.
<!--
   - - [Listanalchem](https://gitlab.com/homochirality/listanalchem):
   -     Tool written in Python to check for homochirality in chemical reaction networks.
   -->

## Research/Coding Interests ##

I have been enthrawled by computers, algorithms and programming languages for over a
decade now. As any other computer guy, I like to try to solve everything by discretizing
and writing down a problem as a computer program.

From the many languages that I have learnt, used, forgotten and hated, the languages I
have the most experience in are Python, C and Haskell, in descending order of coding prowess.
Some other languages I have a bit of experience on include Agda, Scheme, Ruby, Java,
Scala, miniKanren, Bash, and Janus (Reversible Programming Language).

<!--
   -Although I have been fascinated by the power of programming languages and their
   -capabilities in the past, I am much more a tool user than a tool designer myself nowadays.
   -Still, I like to build tools when I see the need for them.
   -->

If there is one thing constant about what I have done in my research and professional
career is that I enjoy exploring unexpected, new, weird and creative ideas on virtually
anything. I have had the luxury of exploring many areas of computer science, including:
programming languages theory, (everybody's current favourite topic) machine learning,
software verification, parallel programming, and simulation (of chemical networks and of
neural networks); yet I feel a need to know more, to explore more and to talk about these
subjects in the larger framework of life. Currently I am working on building a
neuromorphic simulator for HPC (High Performance Computing) and trying to answer "what is
this new paradigm most useful for?"

To see some of the projects I have worked on, you can take a look at
[my github page][github-helq].

## (Past) Teaching ##

I find teaching very rewarding, even though I have only been able to perform as a Lecturer
for two terms. During 2018, I was a Teaching Assistant/Lecturer in the Faculty of
Engineering at [UNAL][nacho]. I taught Intro to Programming in C++ (Programaci√≥n de
Computadores) for the [2018-I](teaching/coding-2018-I/) and
[2018-III](teaching/coding-2018-III/) terms.
