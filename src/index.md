## Teaching ##

I'm a master's student at the [UNAL][nacho]. I'm, also, currently a teacher assistant in
the Faculty of Engineering.

[Intro to Programming with C++ (Programación de Computadores) - 2018-I](teaching/coding-2018-I/)

## Research Interests ##

I've been always inclined for obscure and seemingly math heavy areas of programming
languages, such as Functional Programming and Type theory behind it. Thanks to my love to
learning programming languages I have tried to learn many of them, including (non
extensibly) Haskell, C++, Python, Scheme, Ruby, Java, Scala, miniKanren, and Bash.

I've studied also more traditional stuff outside of programming languages such as Machine
Learning (some theory and practice) and Deep Learning, Theory of (Parametric) Complexity,
and sound and image processing/manipulation.

You can look at what have I done in the passing years on [my github repositories][github]
and in some (actually only one) entries on my [blog](/blog).

## Other stuff about myself ##

Well, I like to write nowadays, but I haven't released anything to the public (yet).

In my house there is a kitty. We, my family and I, love her. And I suffer from chronic[^joking]
paranoia, I mean, I don't have any public profile, except for this one.

[^joking]: not really, it's just joking. It is a hyperbole, I just don't like companies
  taking my info for free.
