## Class's plan ##
- ask about if they have any question about the topics of last week topic (struct, switch)
- ask students if everything is going alright in their groups, if everybody is coperating.
  If somebody is not doing anything, then tell them that they should try to talk to that
  person. If that person is not working, then write then an email telling them that if
  they don't work they'll be kick out of the group with a CC to me.
- ask for their progress in their projects
- any questions on the snake example project
