## Class's plan ##

- Booleans in C++ (how are they represented)
- ask students how many classes are they taking
- state clear that you want the students to have enough time to take the class, if they don't have the time, they should cancel
- ask students to give me a list of things that could go wrong and make a program don't run
- Explain scope
- Explain representation of numbers in memory (negative numbers)
- Exercises with if's
  * given a and b variables with some values, write some code to make sure the smallest number is in a (write some code to print results)
  * a program that tells me if a number is positive, negative or zero
  * write a program to check whether a number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5
  * write a program that gives you the day of the week (0 is sunday and 6 is saturday)

### Executed actions ##

- Explained what scope is (using the example 030) (not truth for second group)
- The example 030 talks about divisibility of natural numbers, I talked about the diagram
  representing the partial order of divisibility
- I told them about which set is bigger, naturals or integers (and all the other examples)
- Someone asked why are floats not that good, I explained to them how are numbers
  represented (unsigned), and then how to represent signed numbers (one's and two's
  complement, veeery long)
- Finally, some exercises:
  * given a and b variables with some values, write some code to make sure the smallest number is in a (write some code to print results)
  * a program that tells me if a number is positive, negative or zero
  * write a program to check whether a number is divisible by 2, 3, or 5
  * write a program that gives you the day of the week (0 is sunday and 6 is saturday)

## Homework ##

## Notes ##
- Next time put all exercises at the beginning of the lecture, so anybody who wants to
  advance can do it
- A student said that the explanation on how are numbers represented (one's and two's
  complement was very hard)
