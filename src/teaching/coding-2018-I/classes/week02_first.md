## Class's plan ##
- Show fast how to compile a simple program using the command line
- Show how to compile using the Code::Blocks
- Ask them for examples that are difficult to understand from the book
- Exercises using only variables
- Use flowcharts with operations available in C++, this time it shouldn't be that
  informal, like the first time.

### Executed actions ##
- Asked how many of them had read, not all, half of them (I explained simple things based on what they don't know, they don't know anything)
- Forced them to copy the code to the computers they're using
- Show how to compile using the Code::Blocks
- Asked for questions from the book, got a couple
- How to print an endline
- Explained what a variable is and how to declare it
- Ask them to solve a simple problem, how to swap two variables (only in one group)
- Use flowcharts with operations available in C++, this time it shouldn't be that informal, like the first time.
- I wrote a flowchart and ask them to write it down in code (ps, I noticed here that many couldn't do it :S)

## Homework ##

## Notes ##
- I scared a student making him pass to the blackboard, I'm never gonna do this anymore
- All (or so I heard) students read already all the material for the class and they knew
  already how to answer several things, I tried to explain things that I shouldn't have
  explained, I got to `if`s in the class (topic for next class, actually)
