## Class's plan ##

- Quiz on: My name, and three programming exercises from the book
- Hand guide for the day
- Boolean operations
- Truth tables
- Booleans in C++ (how are they represented)
- Ask for the result of applying the rules
- Explain set theory basics

### Executed actions ##
- Quiz on: My name, and two programming exercises from the book
- Explained quiz (including swap of variables trick)
- Truth tables (p, q, r, p and q, p or q, p then q, (p and q) then (p or r), not (p and q), not q and not p, not q or not p)
- Explained boolean operations one by one (above) and ask them to do them first, then I told them about each one of them
- Wrote a flowchart with C++ code and a boolean operation
- Showed them why negation of a boolean operation makes things weird
- D'Morgan's laws (for predicates)
- (Side note: I told them what binomial(n,m) is equal to)
- Explain set theory basics (union, intersection, complement, ...)
- D'Morgan's laws (for sets)
- In general d'Morgan's laws apply to boolean algebras (explain next time what is an algebra, or why is it called like that)
