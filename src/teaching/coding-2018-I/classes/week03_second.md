## Class's plan ##
- ok now, I can get to learn their names!
- ask students after the quiz to stay to asked them to present themselves very fast (name,
  career, major hobby), also:
  * the class, as they have noticed is very hard, this is because of two reasons, it is a
    difficult subject to grasp and because I'm gonna go fast so we can, hopefully, finish
    3/4 weeks before everybody else
  * I think I've decided what kind of final project I want:
    + write the code for a game, I will give them the games
    + the project will be on groups as I'll assign them. They need to learn to work with
      people they don't know, because that is how real work in companies are.
    + The code will cost 60% of the grade, 40% a quiz on their own code (how will it be,
      it is still to be determined)
    + if the sum of their grades on that quiz are bigger than some threshold I will give
      them a bonification, how much? it is still to be determined
- ask seriously to students, who think the class is boring, or better the subject is
  boring, tell them they will have to work harder than anybody else to match the grades,
  if they only think on grades
- tell students that one way to learn tricks is reading code from others, there are always
  new things to learn, always! also, you can learn a lot from the errors others make
- what are valid names for variables
- talk about signed and unsigned
- exercise: write a program that given the three coefficients of a quadratic formula gives
  you back the roots of the equation
- exercise: write a program that takes three ints representing the three degrees in a
  triangle and print on the screen if the triangle is equilateral, isoceles or rectangle
- Tell them about Kilobytes vs Kibibytes
- Explain float numbers
- Booleans in C++ (how are they represented)
- show example about how floats are weird!
- ask students how many classes are they taking
- ask students to give me a list of things that could go wrong and make a program don't run
- talk about phonetics

- talked about phonetics (voiced vs voiceless: f v, s z, sh --, ch --, left to explain
  th's, and vowels)
