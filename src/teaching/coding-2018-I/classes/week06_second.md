## Class's plan ##
- next time in class, tell students from the fisrt day how failure is not bad, it's useful
  to fail. If you never fail, you are not taking risks and you will not experiment,
  experimenting it's very valuable because only experimenting you can get anywhere (or
  maybe, from third quiz)
- quiz them and give solutions to it
- ask students to give me a list of things that could go wrong and make a fail (compiling
  and running)
- explain switch case and example of use for giving students grades
- explained phonetic of vowels (chart for the phonetics)
- tell them there are ways to define our own types in C++ which we can use to simulate our
    own sets to operate with, this topic thou is not essential and will be a thing that we
    will see in the future
- tell students how our culture doesn't value agood feedback and how we lie
  to every one all the time. I'm direct (or try to be), so don't think you're stupid I
  just want you to improve. On the same train of ideas: "Kids you can tell me, openly,
  improve on this or we think you should do that, I won't feel hurted. It is stupid from
  our culture but we say that everything is so nice even when is shit just to not make
  others feel bad."
- in the university you don't study like you did in school, in school I didn't need to
  practice, the teacher repeated the same so many freaking times that I just learn by
  "osmosis", that doesn't happen in the uni, beware kids, you need to study by your own, a
  lot
- tell students about tutorías académicas

### Executed actions ##
- quiz them and give solutions to it
- tell them there are ways to define our own types in C++ which we can use to simulate our
  own sets to operate with, this topic thou is not essential and will be a thing that we
  will see in the future
- Damn, I don't recall what we did :S
