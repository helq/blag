## Class's plan ##

### Executed actions ##
- Quiz on references, recursion,
- Talked about german phonetics: aeiouäëü

## Homework ##
- Tried to explain arrays and showed them what happens when we access a region of memory
  which we weren't meant to access because we didn't ask for that memory space (using
  snake game example)
- Put them two exercises to do with arrays:
  * in an array of size 30 put all numbers of fibonacci from 0 to 29
  * write in an array the following sequence of numbers 0,-1,1,-2,2,...,30,-30
