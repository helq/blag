## Class's plan ##
- ask students to give me a list of things that could go wrong and make a fail (compiling
  and running)
- tell them to read the whole book, I may assume you know all that it is in the book,
  there are many little details that I explain in the book that I may not do in class
- remind them how to read the book! If they're not doing it right, they will not learn!
- explain switch case and example of use for giving students grades
- explained phonetic of vowels (chart for the phonetics)

### Executed actions ##
- asked for questions from taller, they asked how to write the `toSmallCaps` function from
    "assignment"
- told them I suffer from the curse of knowledge! I cannot know what they don't know about
    what I know very well, and it makes me a very bad professor T_T
- tried to explained what a function is
- showed examples of functions definitions, several ways to do so:
  f(x) = x^2
  or
  f : R -> R
      n |-> n^2
  for example, or with another function:
  g(b,x) = { 0 if b == true
           { x otherwise
  or
  g : B x R -> R
      (T, n) |-> 0
      (F, n) |-> n
- told them how to write down a math function into C++, where does the type goes and what
    it means
- showed them how to convert the code we had to print a "circle" (exercise 100) in console
    with characters into something a little more complex, a walker (file:
    `week06_circle_and_walker_with_time.cc`)
- told them that the `toSmallCaps` code was to appear on the quiz

## Homework ##
- convert the incomplete code of the walker into the fullfledged walker (ie, the code I
    have written and saved with all the classes)
