## Class's plan ##

### Executed actions ##
- Explained what `for all` and `exists` logical things are, and how to use them to write a
  predicates (this took me about an hour):
  * what they mean, and the example of why `for all exists` is not the same as
    `exists for all`
  * negation of `for all`s and `exists`s
- Tried to explain recursion asking them to tell me what a program did:
  * first what a for loop outputed in console
  * then what a for loop in reverse outputed in console
  * then what a recursive function (outputing the thing above) outputed
  * asked them to write down a recursive function to output what the original forward loop
    outputed
  * then a recursive function that returns something (a simple addition)

## Notes ##
- I only gave this class to the second group, the first group didn't have class because it
  was holiday
