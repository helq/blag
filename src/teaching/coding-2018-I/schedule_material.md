You must read and study the material all material assigned for the week before class
(including the tasks for home). We will build on the material you read.

## Material ##

[**C++ Book (version 0.1.*)**](https://github.com/helq/the-little-cppler-book/raw/master/the_little_cppler.pdf)

Compiler and IDE: [Code::Blocks Dev-C++](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26). Download
and install the version that contains **mingw-setup** in its name.

Additional material: A beginner's guide to programming in C++ <http://www.learncpp.com/>,
the guy who runs the site usually answers to readers questions (read others questions,
many are very interesting).

Additional material (in Spanish) in the university webpage: <http://unmoocs.unal.edu.co/>

"C++ Book (v0.1.a)" means that to study that week material, you need to have the version
v.0.1.a! The version of the book appears on the first page.

If you have a version that is older than v0.1.a (eg, I ask you to study with version
0.1.5 but you have v0.1.4), then you will most probably miss some added exercises that the
older versions didn't have.
