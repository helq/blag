title: Schedule and Material - Intro to Programming
---

You must read and study the material all material assigned for the week before class
(including the tasks for home). **We will build on class on the material you read**.

## Material ##

[**C++ Book (version 0.1.8)**](https://github.com/helq/the-little-cppler-book/raw/master/the_little_cppler.pdf)

Compiler and IDE: [Code::Blocks Dev-C++](http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26). Download
and install the version that contains **mingw-setup** in its name.

Additional material:

- A beginner's guide to programming in C++ <http://www.learncpp.com/>, the guy who runs
  the site usually answers to readers questions (read others questions, many are very
  interesting).
- "La Ciencia de Programar": The exams are based on this book
