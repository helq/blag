I've been always inclined for obscure and seemingly math heavy areas of programming
languages, such as Functional Programming and Type theory behind it. Thanks to my love to
learning programming languages I have tried to learn many of them, including (non
extensibly) Haskell, C++, Python, Scheme, Ruby, Java, Scala, miniKanren, and Bash.

Some of my projects related to these things:

- [Checking at compile time size of tensors in TensorFlow library (for haskell) (2017-2018)][tensorflow-haskell-deptyped]
- [An introductory book to C++][cppler], used to teach ["Intro to Programming" at UNAL (2018)](/teaching/coding-2018-I)
- [A lambda calculus calculator (2014)](https://github.com/helq/simple-interpreter)
- [Simple functional programming interpreter (2014)](https://github.com/helq/simple-interpreter)

I've studied also more traditional stuff outside of programming languages such as Machine
Learning (some theory and practice) and Deep Learning, Theory of (Parametric) Complexity,
and sound and image processing/manipulation. Some of the code I could find in
my github on the topics:

- Machine Learning using haskell [(class assignment) (2017) using Grenade lib][mlwh1]
- [Song recognition in matlab][songrecognition], based on [this blog post][howshazam] and a [paper][shazampaper]

You can look at more things I have done in these years on
[my github repositories][github] and in some (actually only one) entries on my [blog](/blog).
