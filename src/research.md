I am currently dipping my toes in Static Verification of Stochastic Processes with
professor [Carlos Varela][carlos] and his group [WCL][wcl]. The goal of the group's
research is the construction of verified aviation systems to prevent airplane accidents.

In my masters at [UNAL][unal], I studied in depth how to check for errors produced by
mismatched tensors in machine learning applications. The result of my work, with the help
of my advisors [Fabio González][fabio] and [Felipe Restrepo Calle][felipe], was an abstract
interpreter which could be used as a linter to check for common errors in tensor
operations using NumPy in Python. Both, the [code (interpreter)][absint] and the
[thesis document][thesis], can be found online in my github page.

I also worked for over two years as developer/researcher for a chemistry and maths
collaboration project at UNAL, [Germina][germina] under the lead of professor
[Jesús Ágreda][agreda] and the maths expertise of professor [Juan Andrés Montoya][andres]. We
explored different algorithms that might help on finding chemical networks that explain
homochirality, a phenomenon found in nature and argued to be a key part of life itself.
The result of the colaboration can be found at [Gitlab Homochirality Group][homochirality-group].
