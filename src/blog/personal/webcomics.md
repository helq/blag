This document lists all those individual comics I've found funny over the years. I've been
doing this for, probably, more than 4 years (date of writing: 2017.05.09).

**SPOILER ALERT:** I've tried to add a small explanation to each comic. The explanation is
solely with the purpose of reminding me what is the comic about. MANY contain spoilers!

DISCLAIMER: For a comic to be in the list, it must have made me laugh or chuckle, which
means, I liked the comic when I read (past tense) it, but it doesn't mean that I like it
now or that you should like it at all. My taste on what is funny has changed over the
years. It is a quite normal thing. It is as normal as it is the change on my taste on
movies, music, books, people, academic pursuits, language, ... What AM I? I've changed so
much that I ain't the same person I was few years ago. And, wait! All those versions of me
are dead! Sorry mom, your son is dead. Anyway, what did I just write? This is not the
place to write my melancholic thoughts ... Wait! This place is mine, so I CAN! Anyway,
enjoy your procastination time. Most comics are in English, but there are some in Spanish
and German, and because of that the explanations are too in the three languages.

Also, this document is full of mistakes. Don't get angry at me. Get angry at younger and
naïver me :P
