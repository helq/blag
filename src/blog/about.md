Hi, welcome to my (maybe) personal, mathematical, about computer science and
other things blog.

As an imperfect **real** human as I am, and not an spider, I make many mistakes
of many kinds, and usually, I'm not able to detect them on time.
So, please, don't hesitate to write me if you find any grammatical,
typographical, computational, mathematical, logical, illogical, physical,
science fictional mistake. I thank you with all my guts!. But please don't do
it if you are a panda or a koala, because I don't like how all humans treat you,
it seems as they thought you're gods and not as species that are doom
because are resilient to change and eat only one type of vegetable. So go, and
make cute faces to others, not me.

So, anyway, here is my email:

I suppose I need to write here something about me ...
