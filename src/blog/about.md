Hi, welcome to my (maybe) personal, mathematical, computer science and other
things blog.

As I am an imperfect **real** human, and not a spider, I make many mistakes
of many kinds and usually I’m not able to detect them on time. So, please,
don't hesitate to write to me if you find any grammatical, typographical,
computational, mathematical, logical, illogical, physical or science fictional
mistake. I thank you with all my guts! But please don’t if you are a panda or
a koala, because I don’t like how all humans treat you. It seems like they
think you're like gods and not like species that are doomed because are not
resilient to change and eat only one type of vegetable. So go and make cute
faces to others, not to me.

So, anyway, here is my email:

I suppose I need to write here something about me [...](https://xkcd.com/1530/)
