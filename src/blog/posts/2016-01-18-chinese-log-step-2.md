_This article is part of a series of posts on my Chinese learning experience,_ _for more
information visit the [main series page](/blog/posts/2016/01/en/my-chinese-learning-log/)_

My first 'real' step into learning Chinese has been to learn the pronunciation of vowels
and consonants in Chinese (or rather, the initials and finals), and later combine them and
learn to distinguish between the different tones.

The Chinese syllables are composed of two parts an (optional) initial and a final, so my
first step was getting to know the initials and the finals. But first of all, I learnt the
basics of IPA:

## 1. IPA ##

I use IPA to know approximately the sound of every consonant and vowel. For an explanation
of the IPA system visit [IPA explanation | Pronunciation/Ear training](https://fluent-forever.com/chapter3/)
from [Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com), it is fundamental!.

Then you can read [IPA for Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Mandarin).

And don't forget to read the [Pinyin Article (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin)
as we will base our learning in pinyin.

## 2. Initials ##

For the initials I first read the Wikipedia's Pinyin Article (or some of it) and then I
create an [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) Deck with "all" the initials using different audio
recordings (links to all audio sources at the bottom of this post), you can download the
deck from [Anki Shared Decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/):
[Pinyin - Initials - Multiple recordings per initial](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2069190049),
**NOTE:** the deck uses the Anki Addon [Replay Button](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/498789867)
and relays heavily on it to work, thus this Anki Deck only works in Desktop Anki and its
installation is mandatory.

I got the IPA transcriptions from [All Set Learning](http://resources.allsetlearning.com/chinese/pronunciation/Pinyin_chart)
and slightly modified them with the Pinyin/IPA Description from Wikipedia's Article.

## 3. Finals ##

For the finals I did exactly the same as with the initials. You can find the deck from
ankiweb: [Pinyin - Finals - Multiple recordings per final sound](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/509132394).

## 4. Pairs of difficult sounds ##

Some sounds are incredibly difficult for me to tell them apart, but as I read in
[Fluent Forever](https://fluent-forever.com/gallery/ear-training-flashcards/),
I could just hear one recording ([repeat it](http://www.sciencealert.com/here-are-4-key-strategies-for-remembering-everything-you-learn))
and try to guess to which of two sounds does it correspond. For that, I create (guess
what) an Anki Deck. For space reasons, I uploaded the [deck alone](/blog/data/pinyin/Pinyin__Pairs-v0.1.apkg)
(without the media files (audios)) and the media files separated in a `.zip` file, which
you can find at the bottom of the post.

To add new pairs you only need to create (it's called `add` in Anki) a new card and fill
the fields with the right information:

* __Pair Sounds:__ Sounds that are difficult for you to differentiate
* __Written Sound 1:__ The first of the two (or three) difficult sounds
* __IPA 1:__ First sound IPA notation
* __Written Sound 2:__ Same as 1
* __IPA 2:__ Same as 1
* ...
* __Audio 1:__ Audios followed by their IPA notation, don't forget to separate each audio
  with an `EOF`
* __Audio 2:__ Same as `Audio 1`
* ...
* __Extra Info:__ Additional info you want to be displayed in the "back" of the card.

You can get the audio and its IPA notation from the file:
[all_with_IPA_per_sound.csv](/blog/data/pinyin/all_with_IPA_per_sound-v0.1.csv).
I got all right pinyin sound possibilities from
[ArchChinese](http://www.archchinese.com/chinese_pinyin.html).

## 5. Tones ##

In [this Anki Deck](/blog/data/pinyin/Pinyin__Tones-v0.1.apkg) you will find 30 cards to
practice tones. Every time a card is displayed an audio will play with a random tone (from
one of the four "possible" tones), and you need to guess which one it is.

**Note:** this Anki Deck is huge, in fact it contain all the pinyin sounds which are
spoken (not all the possible pinyin and tones combinations, those are many more). You can
find the audio media on a zip at the bottom of this post.

Beware: there are two kinds of 3rd tones in the recordings. The first, the 'traditional',
the tone that is learn everywhere, and the second, the 'spoken' or 'real' tone, the tone
which you should learn to speak Chinese for a detailed explanation see
[Toward Better Tones in Natural Speech](http://www.sinosplice.com/life/archives/2008/12/10/toward-better-tones-in-natural-speech).
