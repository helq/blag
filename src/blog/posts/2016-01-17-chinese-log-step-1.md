_Updated: 2019.05.29_

Few years ago, in 2016, I started to learn Chinese, but I very quickly realised what a
humongous task it was. I had planned to document my whole journey into learning a new
language but reality struck hard. So, here I am, updating this for the first time in years
to tell you that I did not learn much Chinese with the methodology, I wanted to use, and
opted for something less hard core, something that takes me 30 minutes a day. So far, so
good. I have tried hard to learn the sounds of the language, some grammar, some basic
phrases, and I have gone full into hearing conversations.

**_Original article:_**

_This article is part of a series of posts on my Chinese learning experience, for more
information visit the [main series page](/blog/posts/2016/01/en/my-chinese-learning-log/)_

Here are the web pages I found useful when reading about Chinese Language as a complete
beginner (huh, I'm talking like I knew Chinese, for the record: I'm a beginner!). Not all
links are meant to be helpful for the beginner though, they're just resources I found
useful.

The bold links are the most relevant for the first stage of the learning process, the
pronunciation part. But I think it's worthed to read all the links to get an initial
picture of the Chinese language.

First of all, why do you wanna learn chinese?
----------------------------------------------

- **[Goals and motivation, part 1 – Introduction](http://www.hackingchinese.com/goals-and-motivation-part-1-introduction/)**

  Chinese, and I decide for Chinese because is the hardest from my mother language
  (Spanish))
