I've recently noticed---ok, that's a lie---somebody noticed quite some time ago that all
flashy, click-batty articles that start with a question in their title can be easily
answerable with a No.

> Did You Know That Kids Can Get Sick From Their Pets?

> Will The Market Stay Stable After I Retire?

> Has People Been Thinking About What Children Will Be Thinking If We Keep On Focusing
> Solely On Our Biased Moral Guidelines Instead Of Allowing Them To Grow Up?

> Does She Like Me?

It's a good rule of thumb. It works most of the time, or sometimes, or, actually, it will
depend on the title. Yeah, let's go with that. In reality, the truth value, the answer,
depends on what is being asked.

Well, I want to claim that even _that_ is a lie. It is in fact impossible to answer this
post's question irrefutably.

Gotta love Russell's paradox :).
