My main interests are in Programming Languages, specifically in Functional Programming,
and Static Analysis, though I've worked in Machine Learning and Signal Processing, where I
know how to do a couple of things.

I do love to learn new Programming Languages, mainly those which are completely different
to what I'm used to see. Some of the languages I've tried and liked are: Haskell, C++,
Python, Scheme, Ruby, Java, Scala, miniKanren, Janus, and Bash.

Some of my projects on the area of Programming Languages:

- [Static Value Analysis of tensor/array operations in Python](https://github.com/helq/pytropos).
  It's a piece of software I wrote as part of my Master's work.
- [Checking at compile time the size of tensors using the TensorFlow library for Haskell (2017-2018)][tensorflow-haskell-deptyped]
- [An introductory book to C++][cppler] that I used to teach ["Intro to Programming" at UNAL (2018)](/teaching/coding-2018-I)
- [A lambda calculus calculator (2014)](https://github.com/helq/lambda_grammar)
- [Simple functional programming interpreter (2014)](https://github.com/helq/simple-interpreter)

I've also done some stuff in other Computer Areas such as Machine Learning (some theory
and practice) and Deep Learning, Theory of (Parametric) Complexity, and Sound and Image
processing/manipulation. Code for some of these stuff:

- Machine Learning using haskell [(class assignment) (2017) using Grenade lib][mlwh1]
- [Song recognition in matlab][songrecognition], based on [this blog post][howshazam] and a [paper][shazampaper]
<!--TODO: Add reversible programming stuff (language and reversible nns)-->
